Second, they understand the value of natural fibers and most of their products feature natural materials and are good quality. SwaddleDesigns and SwaddleMe use cotton, while Woolino specializes in Australian merino wool. Woolino said that they want customers to be 'thrilled' upon receiving their products. Their close-to-5-star ratings demonstrate that they are quite successful in achieving the effect.">

	<p>In this article we will review three dedicated swaddle and baby sleep sack brands. We choose them primarily for two reasons. For one, they focuse on creating and producing products for the specific niche of baby sleep. Therefore they devote attention to every detail that would help make the youngest consumers safe, warm, and comfortable. This leads to thoughtful designs. For another, they understand the value of dressing babies in natural materials, and most of their products feature natural materials, cotton and merino wool, and are good quality. The three brands are:</p>

<h2 id="SwaddleDesigns"><i class="fa fa-binoculars mr-3" style="font-size: 1.8rem" aria-hidden="true"></i>SwaddleDesigns Review</h2>				
	<p>SwaddleDesigns has three main lines of products: Swaddle blanket (cloth), swaddles, and sleep sacks, all thoughtfully designed by Lynette, a registered nurse who used to work with newborns and a mom of two. She created products based on her 3-stage sleep system, which has been adopted by some American hospitals.</p>
	<h3>3 Stages of Sleep and Products for Each Stage</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Stage 1: Newborn, from birth to about 3 months, before baby can turn or roll</li>
			<li>Stage 2: Small infant, from about 3 months to about 6 months, baby may turn and roll</li>
			<li>Stage 3: Infant and early toddler, about 6 months and older</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">The product for the first stage is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SwaddleDesigns-Swaddle-Sleeves-Mitten-Months/dp/B07HHRCKS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=swaddledesigns+omni+swaddle+sack+with+adjustable+wraps&qid=1595269995&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=402396aba1a48d5f8d83950c9a734f3c&language=en_US" target="_blank">Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup></a></span> (photo in the swaddle section of <a href="how-to-dress-baby-for-sleep.html" target="_blank"><i>How to dress your baby for sleep</i></a>). Because of the designer and mompreneur's professional background, the Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup> is unique in the following two aspects:</p>
		<ul class="fa-ul pl-4 pr-4">				
			<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-diamond" aria-hidden="true"></i><span><b>It includes both sleeves and wing-like wraps.</b></span> The unique design allows multiple arm positions, from both arms wrapped in over the chest to one or both arms by the face or raised up. This fills a range of functions, from full suppression of the startle reflex to free arms and hands with no suppression. The sleeves boast flexible cuffs and are half length for a good reason. The shorter sleeves help the baby feel secure and keep hands close to the face. The cuffs can be closed to become mittens or left open for the baby to suckle on a hand to self-sooth. Closed cuffs provide a partial suppression of the startle reflex. The wraps, or wings, adjustable with hooks and loops, can be fastened over the shoulder or under the arms.</li>
			<li class="mt-2"><i class="fa-li fa fa-diamond" aria-hidden="true"></i><span><b>The lower part of it contains a two-way zipper.</b></span> This makes diaper change possible and easy. This is where the Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup> stands out, while most swaddles include a simple closed sack for the legs. The friendly zipper makes it a "swaddle sack", but not just a "swaddle".</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A patent is pending for the Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup>.</p>
		<p>Almost the same size as the Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup>, SwaddleDesigns makes a simple <a>Swaddle Wrap</a>, similar to most swaddles on the market: A pocket or closed sack for legs, no 2-way zipper, and no half-length sleeves. But the Swaddle Wrap is made of the same premium cotton as the Omni and comes only in a 3 pack and with only two pattern designs. The manufacturer declared on its website that their swaddles feature soft hook and loop fasteners, but not Velcro.</p>

		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">The product for the second stage is the Transitional Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup></span>, transitional in the sense that it is between a snug swaddle and a loose-fitting sleep sack and it helps the baby transition from swaddle to sleep sack. When your baby sleeps well with both mitten cuffs open, you will know that he or she is ready for the sleep sack.</p>

The half-length sleeves remain; so do the flexible cuffs.</p> -->
			<hr style="width: 50%">	
		</div> 		
		<p>It is designed for babies from about 3 months old to about 6 months old, a period during which the baby may start to turn and roll. More like a relatively snug sleep sack, this transitional sack partially suppresses the startle reflex. Compared with the Omni Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup>, the wings are gone, and baby arms are free to help with repositioning after rolling. The half-length (or 3/4 length) sleeves remain; so do the flexible cuffs. The baby is still able to self-sooth if at least one cuff is open. The two-way zipper remains, too.</p>
		<p>The Transitional Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup> comes in two sizes. Small is the same size as the Omni, giving parents the option to use two Transitional Swaddle Sacks through the first six months, if the baby hates to be restrained in swaddling. The design of the Transitional Swaddle Sack<sup>R</sup> has been patented.</p>
		<p>Both the Omni and the Transitional Swaddle Sacks are certified by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute to be hip healthy.</p>
		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">The product for the third stage is the loose-fitting, sleeveless sleep sack or wearable blanket.</span></p>
		<p>The cotton flannel and cotton knit sleep sacks by SwaddleDesigns are summer bags with a TOG rating of 0.7 for sleep environments of 72-78&#8457; (22-25.5&#8451;). Even lighter and thinner is the cotton muslin sleep sack with a TOG rating of 0.3 for sleep environments of 76-80&#8457; (24-26&#8451;). Either of these cotton sleep sacks could complement the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Season-Australian-Merino-Months/dp/B004FJL92K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=baby+sleep+sack+wool&qid=1591459743&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=65e12e2ecc4f45aa30caa4937db0a52c&language=en_US" target="_blank">Woolino merino wool sleep bag</a> to cover the whole year, from the hot days of summer to the cool nights of winter.</p>
		<p>SwaddleDesigns does have warmer sleep sacks of TOG 1.5 and 2.2. However, they are made of polyester. This is where the company could continue to innovate. While they intend to reduce plastic footprint, they could switch off polyester for natural materials like cotton or wool.</p>
		<p>To help select what fits your baby the best, in the table below we will list basic features of SwaddleDesigns swaddles and sleep sacks that we believe are worth trying out. The information is from the manufacturer located either on Amazon or the manufacturer’s website.</p>

	<p>Besides, SwaddleDesigns is the maker of the first commercial swaddle blanket (cloth), generous size and square, with the 3 steps of swaddling sewed on a label.

<div class="container">
	<h2 id="SwaddleMe"><i class="fa fa-binoculars mr-3" style="font-size: 1.8rem" aria-hidden="true"></i>SwaddleMe Review</h2>	
		<p>SwaddleMe is a brand that is part of Summer Infant. Similar to SwaddleDesigns, their products feature 3 stages of sleep, but with different designs.</p>
		<h3>Products for 3 Stages of Sleep</h3>
			<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">For the first stage, SwaddleMe makes the sleep pod as well as the winged swaddle that fastens with Velcros</span> for babies from birth to about 3 or 4 months, up to 6 months, before they attempt to roll.</p>
			<p>The sleep pod is made of 93% cotton and 7% spandex, which makes it stretchy, allowing movement, and keeps the baby snug with both arms in. The two-way zipper is friendly to diaper change. Does this seem like the easiest sleep option for a new baby? Simply zip up; no need to wrap. It is featured in the swaddle section of the <a href="how-to-dress-baby-for-sleep.html" target="_blank"><i>How to dress your baby to sleep</a></i> article.</p>
			<p>The best-known SwaddleMe product is the winged swaddle. The SwaddleMe Original Swaddle is 100% cotton, which includes a special premie size. The SwaddleMe Original Organic Swaddle is made of 100% certified organic cotton. A 2020 new arrival, Easy Change<sup>TM</sup> Swaddle, features everything in the Original Swaddle plus an Easy Change<sup>TM</sup> zipper along the bottom edge in the shape of an arc, making diaper change really easy. This is absolutely a welcomed addition to SwaddleMe wrap swaddles, considering the Easy Change<sup>TM</sup> zipper is much easier for diaper change than pulling down the flap. However, their luxe editions of swaddles, including the Luxe with Easy Change<sup>TM</sup>, are mostly polyester. We cannot hope more to see SwaddleMe update their designs to natural materials. They also produce a Natural Hug<sup>TM</sup> 2-in-1 swaddle, which features unique arm pockets on the inside of the wings. However, it is made of 65% polyester, and we would not recommend it here.</p>
			<p>Most customers comment on Amazon that SwaddleMe swaddles are good quality and even stand lots of washes. The Velcro closure is large and strong, so strong that the hooks should be covered in the wash (or they will stick fast to other clothes). This feature may be good for keeping the baby in, but may also sound loud when you open it. Hopefully the design is so easy that you do not need to adjust the Velcro much.</p>			
			<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">For the second stage, SwaddleMe makes the Convertible Pod and the Convertible Swaddle.</span> These two products cater to babies who can roll, roughly from 3 or 4 months up to 9 months old. The sleep pod and winged swaddle designs from the first stage are modified to adjust to and assist babies who want to have arms free or intend to roll while asleep. The sleep pod no longer stays closed, but offers the option to be opened to let baby arms out, either one or both, thus called the Arms Free<sup>TM</sup> Convertible Pod. Along the same line of thought, the Convertible Swaddle allows for either fastening the wings over baby arms or fastening below the armpits, to allow one or two arms out. One feature that makes this swaddle friendlier is that it includes a two-way zipper along the bottom edge. Details and pricing are as follows:</p>

			<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">The third stage features a uniquely designed sleep sack that includes legs</span> (photo in the sleep sack section of <a href="how-to-dress-baby-for-sleep.html" target="_blank"><i>How to dress your baby for sleep</i></a>). It is designed for babies about 6 to 24 months. The leg cuffs can be adjusted to cover baby feet or leave them out. It is also hip healthy. Look at the wide curve at the hip. This design would be appreciated by active babies, if they could express it. We have seen little ones crawling in the one-bag design, which is common in sleep sacks but appears cumbersome for crawling. The legged design may also turn out to be beneficial for safety purposes when babies become toddlers and start making attempts to climb out of the crib. Woolino has a similar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Season-Merino-Walker-18-36m/dp/B01M2C351X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=6f848cdc11a6c1ba1599a4dabdbe6db8&language=en_US" target="_blank">merino wool sleep sack with feet</a>, for babies from 6 months to 3 or 4 years old.</p>

	<h2 id="Woolino"><i class="fa fa-binoculars mr-3" style="font-size: 1.8rem" aria-hidden="true"></i>Woolino Review</h2>
		<p>The creator of Woolino, Mimi, is a mompreneur and designed the product soon after she became a mom. She was running with time to fill a need that was unsatisfied by the market at that time (2010). As an outdoor person, she knew the quality of merino wool that regulates body temperature according to the ambient temperature and believed that it would create a product that is safe, warm, but would not overheat the baby.</p>
		<p>Such is the wonder of the natural fibers of merino wool that it keeps the person warm when the air is cold and cool when the air is warm. Even when it is wet, its warming quality is not compromised. Think of a down duvet. Animal feather has the same quality.</p>
		<p>For this reason, Woolino markets its merino wool sleep sacks as 4-season sleep sacks, which do not have a specific TOG rating. <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">The flagship product is the 4 Season Ultimate Baby Sleep Bag for babies from 2 months to 2 years old</span> (photo in previous article, <a href="how-to-dress-baby-for-sleep.html" target="_blank"><i>How to dress your baby for sleep</i></a>). It is made of 100% superfine Australian merino wool on the inside and 100% organic cotton on the outside, with industry standard certifications for both materials used. The superfine quality of the merino wool makes the product silky soft and smooth, unlike traditional wool, and is comfortable even on the most sensitive skin. Woolino takes pride on its products to each minute detail. Even snaps and zippers are Oeko-Tex 100 certified, free from lead and other harmful substances. The great majority of customers comment that every part of the sleep sack is good quality and lasts. The overall rating on Amazon is 4.8 out of 5.</p>
		<p>The design of the sleep sack is thoughtful and highlights flexibility and durability. It boasts double shoulder snaps on both shoulders as well as under-arm snaps on both sides, making it adjustable for babies during almost the first two years of life. The 2-way zipper along the edge on the side and bottom is super friendly to diaper change. There is even a seat belt slot on the front center that makes it possible to buckle the baby up in the car seat while wearing the sleep sack, no precious sleep disturbed.</p>
		<p>For the quality of the material and the versatile, detailed design, the cost for this sleep sack up front is a bit high. But considering that it is good for most of the year and lasts over time, sometimes through more than one kid, it is good value for the money. And consider the quality of sleep for both the baby and parents.</p>
		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">Of the same quality and design is Woolino’s 4 Season Ultimate Toddler Sleep Bag</span>, size 2-4 years.</p>
		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">A bit less costly than the Ultimate Sleep Bag is the 4 Season Basic Sleep Bag</span>, using the same material, but a simpler design. No shoulder snaps or underarm snaps or seat belt slot. It comes in three sizes: 0-6 months, 6-18 months, and 18-36 months.</p>
		<p><span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">Woolino’s Walker Sleep Bag includes foot cuffs and can be worn with feet exposed or covered</span> (More about this design in the previous section, <a href="#SwaddleMe">SwaddleMe</a> stage-3 sleep sack). Three sizes are offered: 6-18 months, 18-36 months, 3-4T. No snaps and a simple zipper down the front center, it also costs less than the Ultimate Sleep Bag.</p>

		<h4><i class="fa fa-flag mr-3" aria-hidden="true"></i>Do Woolino’s 4 season sleep bags really work through the whole year?</h4>
			<p>To be precise, if the baby does not have to sleep in a hot summer environment, when the temperature is above 77&#8457; (25&#8451;), the merino wool sleep sack is indeed good for the whole year. Woolino's own description is: The merino wool sleep sacks can be used in room temperatures that range from 63-77&#8457; (17-25&#8451;). If it is true that most homes would heat bedrooms to at least 18-20&#8451; in winter, the only environment in which this sleep sack should be replaced is hot summer days when room temperatures are above 77&#8457; (25&#8451;). When that happens, the baby could sleep in a thin sleeper or in a thin summer sleep bag. <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #cc7a00;">Woolino has already taken this into consideration by offering a 100% organic cotton sack, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Cotton-Sleep-Toddler-Sleeping/dp/B06XJ35W1H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2LT16PDGXF49N&dchild=1&keywords=ecolino+organic+cotton+baby+sleep+bag+or+sack&qid=1601344700&sprefix=ecolino,aps,237&sr=8-5&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=a03a7f8c26274b001be9344176a9a743&language=en_US" target="_blank">Ecolino Organic Cotton Baby Sleep Bag</a></span> (sizes 0-6 months, 6-18 months, and 18-36 months).
			<p>Like most baby sleep sacks on the market, the merino wool sleep sacks are sleeveless. This does leave some parents and caregivers worry: <em><b>What if baby arms are cold?</b></em> The baby can wear a sleeper in the sack, including Woolino's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Footie-Pajama-Sleeper-Merino/dp/B00SGSV2X2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=60cfe0ceb0e1211e03a0c71cf770d59a&language=en_US" target="_blank">merino wool sleeper</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Unisex-Infant-Superfine-Merino/dp/B00SGSSXMU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=e37363a08ef0a7c11e9e841dc32fcf14&language=en_US" target="_blank">nightgown</a>. For some babes, a cotton sleeper inside the bag may be warm enough. Touch behind the baby’s neck. If it does not feel cold or sweaty, the baby is fine. It is not a problem if baby hands or legs are a bit cold to the touch, as they are learning to regulate body temperatures. In fact, babies who do sleep under a traditional blanket rarely keep their arms under the cover.</p>

		<h3>Merino Wool Baby Clothes and Blankets</h3>
			<p>Besides sleep sacks, Woolino makes baby clothing with the same superfine merino wool, including baby <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Unisex-Infant-Superfine-Merino/dp/B00SGSSXMU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=e37363a08ef0a7c11e9e841dc32fcf14&language=en_US" target="_blank">gowns</a> (up to 6 months), long-sleeve <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Unisex-Sleeve-Bodysuit-Merino/dp/B00SGSRWJ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=96caf15c2e0514c7426ea57603a4add1&language=en_US" target="_blank">bodysuits</a> (3-6, 6-12, 12-18 months), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Footie-Pajama-Sleeper-Merino/dp/B00SGSV2X2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=60cfe0ceb0e1211e03a0c71cf770d59a&language=en_US" target="_blank">sleepers</a> (0-3, 3-6, 6-9 months), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Unisex-Footed-Romper-Superfine/dp/B00SGSRJ1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=4797f05d7c74124bf252981e731b4825&language=en_US" target="_blank">footed pants</a> (3-6 months, 6-9 months), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SGSQC1Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&uh_it=91b90661138560bb6d0f3429324ad570_CT&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTkU4NDNMVlI1V0lXJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjkxODY4Q1dRU0M3REtVNkQyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5ODEzODQySzBLVEVXQzlMRFI3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c2Rfb25zaXRlX2Rlc2t0b3AmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=3bfa830df2304b195ddf7b87fe684cae&language=en_US" target="_blank">pajamas</a> (1-2 years, 2-3 years, 3-4 years, 4-5 years). These are 100% merino wool.

			<p>It is not very common to find baby and toddler blankets made of all natural materials. Due to sourcing advantages, Woolino offers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Blanket-Stroller-Merino-Stars/dp/B018HW9WQK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=FBF2OCHPSHBI&dchild=1&keywords=woolino+stroller+blanket&qid=1601766364&sprefix=woolino+stroller+,aps,447&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=97f56a76aa87e353274a8154c248c658&language=en_US" target="_blank">stroller blankets</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woolino-Toddler-Blanket-Merino-Season/dp/B018HVUV98/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&linkCode=ll1&tag=lovenatural0e-20&linkId=da21cfb108a017928e38db30ee1680bb&language=en_US" target="_blank">toddler blankets</a> of the same material and quality of the merino wool sleep sack. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they even make wool duvet and wool pillow for toddlers. Wool duvets, of 100% Australian wool, not necessarily merino, are where Woolino starts to venture outside kid products. Their queen and king wool duvets cannot keep up with demand at the moment.</p>
