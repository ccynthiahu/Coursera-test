		This is my first course on Coursera. I am learning html and CSS to build my first website. I always want a website. This is my chance to build it myself.

		My idea is to have a travel website and present the beautiful places my husband and I have seen in the world. We take lots of photos and videos, which will be an important part of our content. Another important feature is to have a Chinese version of our site, because I really want to present these places to the Chinese market.
